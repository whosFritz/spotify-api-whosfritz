# üéµ Spotify API - whosFritz

This project utilizes the Spotify API with the [spotipy](https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy) library to display my favorite song on my website based on the last 4 weeks. The backend is built with Flask, and the data is stored in MongoDB. MongoDB was chosen for its document-based data architecture.

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple backend service that interacts with the Spotify API to retrieve the user's favorite song from the last 4 weeks. The Flask application serves as an API endpoint that can be integrated into a website to display the user's favorite song dynamically.

**Note:**
For security reasons, this project does not directly connect to the Spotify API from the client side. Instead, it utilizes a Flask backend, ensuring that sensitive information like API credentials is not exposed to the public. Additionally, to mitigate potential issues with the Spotify API rate limits or downtimes, the retrieved data is cached locally, providing a more reliable experience for users.

- Retrieves the user's favorite song from the last 4 weeks using the Spotify API.
- Stores the song data in a MongoDB database for future reference.
- Provides a Flask API endpoint for easy integration into web applications.
- Demonstrates how to use environment variables for secure configuration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, you need to have the following installed:

- Python3 üêç
- Pip (Python package installer) üì¶
- MongoDB (Make sure the MongoDB server is running) üöÄ

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/whosFritz/spotify-api-whosfritz.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd spotify-api-whosfritz
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Set up your Spotify Dev Accout [here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create an App and define the callback-url
3. Set up your Spotify API credentials and MongoDB URI by creating a .env file in the project root:

   ```bash
   SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=your_redirect_uri
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   ENDPOINT_PATH=/your/api/endpoint
   ```

4. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Access the API endpoint in your web browser or integrate it into your website.

   The API endpoint is accessible at:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8088/your/api/endpoint
   ```

   This endpoint returns JSON data containing the user's favorite song information.
